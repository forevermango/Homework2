Coding Problem 2
Write a basic program that performs simple file and mathematical
operations.
a.
Write a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each
date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following
that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the find() method to
parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line
alone. Use the datetime module to get the current date. Ignore any dates
that are later than the current date. Output each correct date as:
3/1/1990.
b.
After the program is working as above, modify the program so that it
reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” (an Example file is
attached).
c.
Modify your program further so that after parsing all dates from the
input file “inputDates.txt”, it writes out the correct ones into an
output file called: “parsedDates.txt”.
Ex: If the input is:
--
 March 1, 1990
 April 2 1995
 7/15/20
 December 13, 2003
 May 1, 2023
 -1
--
then the output is:
--
 3/1/1990
 12/13/2003
--
Commit the changes to your .py into the repository. Don't include the
output file. We will use a different input file for testing your code.
Some of the points will be earned by making proper use of git by having
multiple commits that show the evolution of your code over time so we can
basically see your code at stages a., b., and c. .

ZyLabs coding exercises in ZyBooks
Complete all the ZyLabs in Homework 2 on ZyBooks. You should write all
your code in the PyCharm environment and then submit in ZyBooks as well
as commit to your Github repository.
The solution to each ZyLabs problem should be in its own .py file.
